    those characters in the movie.

    The endpoint ensures that all characters are part of the referenced movie,
    that the characters are not the same, and that the lines of a conversation
    match the characters involved in the conversation.

    Line sort is set based on the order in which the lines are provided in the
    request body.

    The endpoint returns the id of the resulting conversation that was created.
